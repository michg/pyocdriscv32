\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The Roa Logic AHB-Lite Memory IP is a fully parameterized soft IP
implementing on-chip memory for access by an AHB-Lite based Master. 
All signals defined in the \emph{AMBA 3 AHB-Lite v1.0} specifications are
fully supported.

The IP supports a single AHB-Lite based host connection and enables
address \& data widths, memory depth \& target technology to be
specified via parameters. An option to register the memory output is
also provided.
