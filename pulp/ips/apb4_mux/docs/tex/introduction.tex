\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The \emph{AMBA APB v2.0} bus protocol - commonly referred to as APB4 - 
defines a low-cost interface that is optimized for minimal power
consumption and reduced interface complexity. To enable a single APB4
Master to communicate with \emph{multiple} APB4 Slaves (Peripherals) via
a common bus, certain signals require multiplexing -- the Roa Logic APB4
Multiplexer is a fully configurable \& parameterized IP to provide this
functionality as shown below:
