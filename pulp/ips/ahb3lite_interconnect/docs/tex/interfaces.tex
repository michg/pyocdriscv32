\section{Global Signals}\label{global-signals}

The common signals are shared between all devices on the AHB bus. The
AHB-Lite Interconnect has Master and Slave AHB-Lite buses and they all
use the global signals.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lccl@{}}
\toprule
Port & Size & Direction & Description\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\texttt{HRESETn} & 1 & Input & Asynchronous active low reset\tabularnewline
\texttt{HCLK} & 1 & Input & System clock input\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\caption{AMBA3 Global Signals}
\end{longtable}

\subsection{HRESETn}\label{hresetn}

When the active low asynchronous \texttt{HRESETn} input is asserted (`0'), the
core is put into its initial reset state.

\subsection{HCLK}\label{hclk}

\texttt{HCLK} is the system clock. All internal logic operates at the rising edge
of the system clock. All AHB bus timings are related to the rising edge
of \texttt{HCLK}. All Master and Slave ports must operate at the same \texttt{HCLK} clock.

\section{Master Interfaces}\label{master-interfaces}

The Master Ports are regular AMB3-Lite slave interfaces. All signals are
supported. See the AHB-Lite specifications for a complete description of
the signals.

\caption{Master Port Interface}
\end{longtable}

\subsection{mst\_HSEL}\label{mst_hsel}

The Master Port only responds to other signals on its bus when \texttt{HSEL} is
asserted (`1'). When \texttt{mst\_HSEL} is negated (`0') the Master Port
considers the bus IDLE and negates \texttt{mst\_HREADYOUT} (`0').

\bottomrule
\caption{Protection Signals (HPROT)}
\end{longtable}

\subsection{mst\_HREADYOUT}\label{mst_hreadyout}

When a slave is addressed, the \texttt{mst\_HREADYOUT} indicates that the
addressed slave finished the current transfer. The Interconnect IP
routes the addressed slave's \texttt{HREADY} signal to the master.

When no slave is address, the \texttt{mst\_HREADYOUT} signal is generated
locally, inside the Interconnect.

\subsection{mst\_HMASTLOCK}\label{mst_hmastlock}

The master lock signal indicates if the current transfer is part of a
locked sequence, commonly used for Read-Modify-Write cycles. While the
\texttt{mst\_HMASTLOCK} is asserted, the Interconnect IP cannot switch the
addressed slave to another master, even if that master has a higher
priority. Instead the current master retains access to slave until it
releases \texttt{mst\_HMASTLOCK}.

\subsection{mst\_HREADY}\label{mst_hready}

\texttt{mst\_HREADY} indicates the status of the local \texttt{HREADY} on the master's
local bus. It is routed to the \texttt{HREADYOUT} port of the addressed slave.

\subsection{mst\_HRESP}\label{mst_hresp}

\texttt{mst\_HRESP} is the transfer response from the addressed slave, it can
either be OKAY (`0') or ERROR (`1'). The Interconnect IP routes the
addressed slave's \texttt{HRESP} port to \texttt{mst\_HRESP}.

\section{Slave Interface}\label{slave-interface}

The Slave Ports are regular AHB-Lite master interfaces.. All signals are
supported. In addition each Slave Port has a non-standard
\texttt{slv\_HREADYOUT}. See the AHB-Lite specifications for a complete
description of the signals.
